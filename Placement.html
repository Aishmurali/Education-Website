 <p><h2><b><center>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SOFTLOGIC’S PLACEMENTS</center><b></h2></p>
 <p>Sathya Academy is well aware of the fact that a lack of soft skills and aptitude skills are contaminating the IT career dream of youth. Thus free training on soft skills, interview skills, and aptitude skills are offered along with every corporate IT training course.</p>
 <img src="D:\PROJECT\Educational Website\Images\Placement1.jpg" width="1400" height="300"> 
 <p>Under the following terms and conditions, SathyaAcademy will provide its services to you. You are agreeing to these terms and conditions if you visit our website. Pay close attention while you read them. </p>
 <p>All prospective trainees must first register with the SathyaAcademy’s Placement Cell. Only individuals who have signed up with SathyaAcademy’s Placement Cell will be able to take part in the placement programs.</p>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Trainees are recommended to arrive at the interview with an appropriate dress code and polite manner.</li>
 <li>Candidates who have submitted their resumes to a company but who later decide not to show up for the exam or interview should get authorization to do so in advance. As a result, the placement cell will be able to provide the firm with a more precise estimate of the number of candidates who will be present at the interview, which will benefit both the business and the other applicants who could have been passed over.</li>
 <li>If the Candidate is selected in the campus interview and receives an appointment letter, he or she is ineligible to apply again, and his or her name is withdrawn from the placement cell, even if he or she declines the previous job offer.</li>
 <li>Trainees are prompted to keep up a 90%+ attendance rate across all of their technical, soft skills, and aptitude training.</li>
 <li>Trainees must complete at least 30 mock interviews testing their technical knowledge, interpersonal skills, and general aptitude.</li>
 <li>Students are expected to get a passing grade of 65%, 75%, and 85% on the preliminary, intermediate, and final Mock exams, respectively.</li>
 <li>Trainees are encouraged to adhere to all Terms and Conditions in order to fulfill the placement Eligibility Criteria.</li>
 <li>The Course Fee and the Placements are subject to a service tax of 18%.</li>
 <li>Once paid, the Registration Fee, Fine, and Course Fee are non-refundable.</li>
 <li>SathyaAcademy does not charge a fee for its placement services.</li>
